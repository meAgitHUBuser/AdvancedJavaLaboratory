# AdvancedJavaLaboratory

This repository contains Java programs demonstrating various functionalities:

* Working with ArrayLists
* Reading random numbers with specific criteria and sorting them
* Storing user-defined classes in collections
* Utilizing String class constructors
* String manipulation techniques (extraction, comparison, search, modification)
* Working with StringBuffer methods
* Building a Swing event handling application with buttons

## Programs

1. **ArrayList Demonstration:** This program showcases creating an ArrayList, adding elements, removing elements, sorting the list, and using the toArray() method.
2. **Random Number Reader & Sorter:** This program reads random numbers within a specified range, filters them based on divisibility by 2 and 5, sorts them by tens place using a comparator, and displays the results.
3. **User-Defined Classes in Collections:** This program demonstrates storing custom classes within collections.
4. **String Class Constructors:** This program explores different ways to create String objects using various constructors.
5. **String Manipulation:** This program illustrates methods for character extraction, comparison, search, and modification within strings.
6. **StringBuffer Exploration:** This program showcases functionalities offered by the StringBuffer class.
7. **Swing Event Handling Example:** This program demonstrates creating a simple Swing application with two buttons ("Alpha" and "Beta") that display corresponding messages upon clicking.
